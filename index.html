             I was born in Ohio and went to a very small high school in Amish country.  I received my undergraduate degree in MIS from Bowling Green State University, and I have an MBA from Ohio State University.  
             I started my career as a web developer for Progressive Insurance coding classic ASP and javaScript then moved to writing C# and ASP.NET and CSS for Insurance.com.  
             After I received my MBA I got out of coding and spent the next 10 years as a Business Analyst, Product Manager, and even ran an IT PMO for a while. Those 10 years have taught me that it's always good to be 
             the person that can do the work in the trenches, even if you're managing those that are in said trenches.  For that reason I'm returning to my roots and getting back into 
             Web Development.  <br/><br/>
             I have a dog, am passionate about health & fitness, and have a healthy addiction to anything with wheels especially motorcycles.  At one point I owned 4 motorcycles, but I've reduced that down to 1 and a half (it's a long term project); 
             One to ride, and one to work on in my (non existent) free time.
